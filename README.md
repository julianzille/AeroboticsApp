# AeroboticsApp

This app was developed as an onboarding exercise as part of an internship at Aerobotics. The app simply allows users to navigate and view a list of farms and their orchards (with satellite maps). 
The following packages packages and dependencies are required**:
- Expo Go 10.1.0
- Axios 1.5.0
- Typescript 5.2.2
- React 18.2.0
- React Native 0.72.4
- React Native Maps 1.7.1
- React Navigation 4.4.4

Run ```npm install [package-name]@[version-number]``` to install the relevant package.

NB: an API token (stored in a .env file) is required for full functionality. 

** The app may work with newer versions of the packages, but has been tested using the specified versions.
